        "text": "There is no better plumbing company in Howard County as far as I am concerned. I have used Ehrhardt several times over the years and always found them to be skilled and reasonable. My most recent experience, however, was second to none. On Saturday, we noticed the smell of gas in our home and called BGE to respond. BGE confirmed the leak and shut off gas service to the entire house. I called Ehrhardt at the open of regular business on Monday with the prospect of a family of 5 set to arrive later in the day for a weeklong visit being greeted with cold showers and no homecooked meals as both the hot water and stove are on gas. Although Ehrhardt was booked solid until later in the week under regular scheduling, the owner himself understood the situation and personally came to my home with another technician to check the lines and fix the leak with hours to spare. I recommend Ehrhardt without hesitation since they provide all of the services of the \"bigger companies\" without losing the small business customer service.",

Although it was a challenge for a one person but he did not give up. We worked together to move out the stacked washer and dryer, and he improvised a solution.

I don't know what he was doing in his truck for 20 minutes but it doesn't seem fair that I should pay for that time. I also found out that they will not count the $190 towards any work done.
